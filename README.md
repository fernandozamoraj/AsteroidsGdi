# AsteroidsGdi
Remake of the classic game Asteroids using only GDI and C# .Net

It uses plain old GDI and a windows form as the canvas.  

I'll admit that the game play is not identical. I created it with my limited understanding of the physics involved.

All in all its still a fun little game.

Nothing special just import it into the latest version of visual studio, compile and it's ready to play.

It is jus a win forms application.
